Make sure the following signals are visible in Figure~\ref{fig:sim} and the 
signal values are readable:
the program counter in the fetch stage, the instruction being fetched, the 
content of register \texttt{x5} and the fields \texttt{address}, \texttt{rd}, 
\texttt{wr}, \texttt{byteena}, and \texttt{wrdata} in the \texttt{mem\_out} 
signal coming out of the pipeline in the memory stage.
