Make sure that at least the following signals are visible in
Figure~\ref{fig:sim2}: the program counter in the fetch stage, the
instruction being fetched, the content of registers \texttt{x1}, 
\texttt{x2} and \texttt{x3} as well as the signals \texttt{wraddr},
\texttt{wrdata} and \texttt{regwrite} of the register file.
